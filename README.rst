LIBRARY Adafruit TCS34725 Library
============================================

The TCS34725 is a color sensor breakout board. Adafruit originally provided MicroPython code to talk to the board, but
deprecated it when they switched to CircuitPython. However, there is no port of CircuitPython on Micro:Bit.
I am attempting to revive this library to support the Micro:Bit. The current status is "Work in Progress".


Original Readme
---------------
This library has been deprecated! We are leaving this up for historical and research purposes but archiving the repository.

We are only supporting CircuitPython libraries.
